# Game_Solver_FeedFuzzy

The goal of this project is to solve for the winning probabilities for each player in the children's game Feed Fuzzy, given any initial distribution of acorns. In the process, it will also seek to determine the optimal strategies and starting distributions to maximize winning odds for the player on move.
